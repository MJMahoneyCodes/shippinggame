# Shipping Game
 
Try and amass a fortune shipping items for customers. But beware (or not), some customers will try and ship illegal things. Will you 
risk shipping them to earn a profit, in the chance that a postal inspector shuts your business down?

I wanted to create this project to see if I could whip up a quick game. I'm currently in school for programming and development, and one of my classes this semester is on JavaScript.
